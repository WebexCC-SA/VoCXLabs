Modification and Adjusting



Too Wordy
When trying the Voice Bot, you may have noticed that the current instructions make the bot too chatty because it tries to do everything in long sentences. For a Voice AI, you‚Äôll want shorter, conversational prompts that get to the point quickly.

**üéâ Congratulations, you have officially completed the Autonomous Virtual Agent mission! üéâ**
